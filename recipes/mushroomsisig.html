        Mushroom Sisig is a clever, vegetarian-friendly twist on the beloved Filipino classic. Traditionally made with pork, this version swaps the meat for finely chopped king oyster, button, or shiitake mushrooms, which are sautéed until they reach a perfect, meaty crisp.

    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped red onion</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>4 thai chile peppers</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh oyster mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup calamansi</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over <strong>medium-high heat</strong>. Add the onion, garlic, and the white parts of the green onions. Cook and stir for about <strong>3 minutes</strong> until they are fragrant and softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chiles and the chopped mushrooms. Continue cooking for <strong>5 to 8 minutes</strong>, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are tender and all the excess moisture has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Pour in the soy sauce and calamansi juice. Cook for another <strong>5 to 7 minutes</strong>, <strong>stirring constantly</strong>, until the liquid reduces into a thick, savory glaze that coats the mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Give it a quick taste. If you want more "zing," add a splash more calamansi juice; if you want more depth, add a drop more soy sauce until the balance of salty and tangy is just right.</li>
        <li>Serve the dish immediately while steaming hot. Top it with a dollop of avocado oil mayonnaise for richness and a fresh sprinkle of the green onion tops for a pop of color.</li>
    </ol>
