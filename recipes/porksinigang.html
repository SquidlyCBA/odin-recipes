        Pork Sinigang is arguably the ultimate Filipino comfort food. It is a sour, savory soup defined by its signature "asim" (tartness), usually derived from tamarind. While other soups aim for heavy richness, Sinigang focuses on a bright, mouth-watering acidity that cuts through the fat of the pork.
